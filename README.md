# _Installing_

•Take a look at [the downloads page on drawpile.net](https://drawpile.net/download/) or [the GitHub releases](https://github.com/drawpile/Drawpile/releases).

•Instructions on how to compile Drawpile from source are found [on this documentation page](https://docs.drawpile.net/help/development/buildingfromsource).

•If you're using Arch Linux, you can get Drawpile [from the AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/drawpile).


# _Getting Help, Giving Suggestions, Reporting Bugs_

•If you're having trouble with something, want to suggest a feature or report a bug, take a look at [the help page on drawpile.net](https://drawpile.net/help/).

•You can directly [report issues here on GitHub](https://github.com/drawpile/Drawpile/issues). If you got Discord, you can [join the Drawpile server](https://drawpile.net/discord/) on there. You can also [use the chatroom on libera.chat](https://drawpile.net/irc/), it can be done directly through the browser and doesn't need any account.

# _Client Dependencies_

>The Drawpile client uses the following shared libraries:

* Qt (all platforms)
* OpenSSL (all platforms)
* KDE Framework Archive (Windows, Linux AppImage, Android)
* libzip (macOS, Linux Flatpak)


•On Windows, these libraries are signed along with the executable using free code signing provided by [SignPath.io](https://about.signpath.io/) and a  certificate by [SignPath Foundation](https://signpath.org/). See [the code signing policy on drawpile.net](https://drawpile.net/codesigningpolicy/) for details.

•The dependencies are pinned to known good versions and the source code for is verified against the hashes and signatures provided in their releases from upstream. SHA384 hash checks are also done for each build to ensure integrity of the source code retrieved from upstream.

•We make some patches to these dependencies when building the application, which you can find in [.github/scripts/patches](.github/scripts/patches). Each patch file contains a description as to what it does.

•You can find build processes, versions, the upstream source URLs and hashes [for Qt and OpenSSL here](.github/scripts/build-qt.cmake) and [for KDE Framework Archive and libzip here](.github/scripts/build-other.cmake).
